- Sanctifica -
Starts shielded by eyes. Eyes periodically shoot lasers at player
When an eye is destroyed, it explodes in a bullet-hell fashion, shooting "bullets" everywhere
When Sanctifica is able to be hit, she will fly around and periodically shoot spears at the player in an undertale fashion
Another attack will have Sanctifica fly into the sky and then fly down really fast into a player and deal massive damage. (there will be a highlight where she will fly into)
About 15 seconds later, the eyes will return to protect Sanctifica.
When she is below 50% health, she becomes enraged. Eyes will no longer protect her, and instead will float above her head periodically shooting channeled lasers at the player
She will shoot spears faster.
When she is below 25% health, she will periodically have a bullet-hell attack, previous enraged attacks will still occur.
